Project TK-Pong
===============

Purpose:
--------

The goal is to create a game played with hands. In this case we chose to go
for the Pong's one. It's easy to make and give us enough of time to work
on the gesture recognition thing.

The idea is to finish the project in 48 hours or a week-end. This marathon of
code or *hackaton* is also a good way to promote the coding universe to the
beginners.

In this case, the site of this event is the BiB, an Hacker Space in Montpellier,
France. It starts 05/08 at 12pm and end the 05/10 at the same hour.

Technologies used:
------------------

As we are convinced by the fact the Free Software is the future. We will use
free softwares/libraries. Then the code will be released as Drink-ware, meaning
you can do whatever you wan with it, and if you liked what we did, you can buy
us a drink.

Then we'll use HTML5/CSS3 for the frontend and maybe python and/or c++ for the
server. The one who'll have the hand recognition system and the host of the
game.
